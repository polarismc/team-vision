                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Our role within Polaris is less as moderators and more as the passionate people of the community that push Polaris forward. We build the world up and host the events. We're here to help other players when they need it. Did Xenile's 1000+ ping internet get them killed in the nether by lag? Let's help them retrieve his inventory. Did Deen clip his way into your dark soul and can't find the way out? Let's TP him to spawn. Did someone lose their pet turtle and can't find it? Help them out. Is there some kind of burst of drama? Let's work to understand every side of the story and solve the issue in some way that every party is happy. Being a member of Team Polaris is less about "only help if it's our fault" and more "let's make Polaris the most fun it can be".
<br>
<br><strong>We're less admins and more a living part of the community. Less working to strike an unbiased rule, and more likely to work to make Polaris a more fun, safer place.</strong></p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">
                    Every member of Team Polaris contributes, shares their ideas, and gives feedback on the ideas of others. Through this, we can create a more harmonious vision and solve issues at the heart of ideas early. Every member of Team Polaris builds each other up and helps each other when they're down. Through this, we can grow as both people and a team, and every member of Team Polaris fuels the server with their passion to have it grow and become more. Through this, Polaris will continue to become a better, more enjoyable experience for everyone.</p>

                <p class="mbr-text mbr-fonts-style display-7">Polaris Classic started as a side project that took the server back to the traditional, unaltered Minecraft experience that was offered in Season 1. As time has gone on, our focus has shifted almost entirely to Classic and the goal we started with has evolved: Rather than staying strict to the vanilla experience, we've moved to more preserve that experience while implementing our own fun, unique ideas to the world without distracting from that core gameplay that the community loves.<br><br><strong>Every idea and concept for the server should go through the question of "Does this harm the vanilla minecraft experience or add to it?".&nbsp;</strong></p>
